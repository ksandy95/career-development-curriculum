# Module Three Resume Review Workshop

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QVsxi9TL1FQ7QL3w-FA_xnj8iCX095uUcnhJDRvqhiU/edit?usp=sharing)

Directions for Facilitator(s):

1. Assign groups ahead of time with 4-5 students per staff member using the roster of students in Airtable
2. Send groups to staff members ahead of time along with this markdown
3. Everyone will meet in Clarke Hall to find their groups (students will already be in there). Display groups on the monitors by updating the slides linked above. After you kick off the session, groups may move elsewhere if they choose
4. Instruct students to DM their resume drafts to the whole group as PDFs

Directions for Staff Reviewers:
1. Students should have already corrected mistakes in their resume draft in week 2, but if you see mistakes, correct those first. [Use this checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/resume_review_checklist.md)
2. After any initial corrections are discussed, the following questions with each student:

* What is effective and/or stands out to you about this resume?
* What does this resume communicate to you about the student?
* As an employer looking at this resume, what follow-up questions would you have?
* What would make this resume more effective in achieving the goal of helping the student stand out as a professional developer candidate?

Students should be listening, taking notes, and providing feedback for peers
